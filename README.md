- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ryan-MM. I've been tinkering with tech for as long as I can remember.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development, as well as systems dev, languages and theory.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning...well, everyday I try learn something new or at the very least develop my existing skill sets.
- The stack I work with presently is: .Net Framework 4.8.1, C# and VB, T-SQL and SQL Server. I enjoy developing enterprise solutions, particularly desktop apps.
- I use WinForms alot for UI however, I'd like to learn more about WPF and third-party frameworks for UI.
- Eventually, I will learn F#, TypeScript and VC++.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me via email.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

- âš¡ Fun fact: Without Heddy Lamar, we may have developed networks quite differently.
