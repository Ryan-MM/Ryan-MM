- 👋 Hi, I’m Ryan. I've been tinkering with tech for as long as I can remember.

- 👀 I’m always trying to better myself. I love a good challenge and appreciate attention to detail. I like reading about the history of IT, languages and theory.

- 🌱 I've been looking at new architectural models. 
- The stack I work with presently is Windows-based, specifically .Net Framework and MSSQL Server. I enjoy developing enterprise solutions, particularly bespoke desktop apps.
- I use WinForms alot for UI however, I'd like to learn more about WPF and third-party frameworks for UI.
- Eventually, I will learn F#, TypeScript and VC++.

- 📫 How to reach me: via email.

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him

- ⚡ Fun fact: Without Heddy Lamar, we may have developed networks quite differently.
